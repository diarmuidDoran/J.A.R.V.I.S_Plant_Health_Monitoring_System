# J.A.R.V.I.S_Plant_Health_Monitoring_System

Jarvis Plant Health Monitoring System is a program that is designed to check and record your plants health attributes. The system is currently set upto check in on the following plant health attributes:

- Soil Moisture precentage level
- Ambient Air Temperature
- Ambient Air Humidity
- Surrounding Light lux levels

Based on the data collected from the plants registered sensors the program will determine when your plant requires water and automatically pump water from your pre-filled tank. After the program has checked in on your plant it will issue your email with notifications related to the sensor readings and the actions taken.

## Hardware requirements

For this iteration you require the below list of components to construct your own J.A.R.V.I.S_Plant_Health_Monitoring_System:

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-starter-kit" target="_blank"></a>Raspberry Pi 4B (Raspberry Pi 3 should also be compatable with the program)</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

## Installing J.A.R.V.I.S_Plant_Health_Monitoring_System
